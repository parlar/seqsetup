# Custom UMI Dual Index Kit
# For libraries with inline UMIs requiring special read override patterns
# This is an example demonstrating advanced override cycle configurations

description: "Dual indexes for UMI-tagged libraries with 8bp inline UMI"
comments: "Example kit for UMI workflows. Read override patterns extract UMI from read start."
